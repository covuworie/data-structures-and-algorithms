# 4. Big O: Intro

## What is Big O?

Big O is a way of comparing sets of code that accomplish the same task.

**Big O** is a way of *comparing sets of code* (*mathematically*) to determine *how efficiently they run*.

The efficiency of code is usually measured in the following two ways.

### Time Complexity

Time complexity is not measured in time. If you took the same code and ran it on a computer that runs twice as fast, it would complete twice as fast. A measure is needed that is independent of computer hardware.

**Time complexity** is the *number of operations* that a piece of code takes to complete.

### Space Complexity

**Space complexity** is the amount of memory that a piece of code utlizes during execution.
