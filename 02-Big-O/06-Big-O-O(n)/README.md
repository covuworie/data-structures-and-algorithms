# 6. Big O: O(n)

## What is O(n)?

The efficiency of code is **O(n)** if we get the straight-line graph $O(n) = n$ when we plot the size of the input n versus O(n). The complexity is said to be proportional to or vary linearly with the input size n.

#### Example

The `print_items` function is O(n). We passed the function an integer input n and it ran n operations.
