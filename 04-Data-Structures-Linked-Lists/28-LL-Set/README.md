# 28. LL: Set

The LinkedList set method takes an index and a value as its parameters and sets the value at that index.

The logic is similar to the get method in terms of finding the node we need to update and checking if the index is valid so we can just reuse that code by setting the temp variable to its value. If we get back a Node then we set the value and return True otherwise we return False.
