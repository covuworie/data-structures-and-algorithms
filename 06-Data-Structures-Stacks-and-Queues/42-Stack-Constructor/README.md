# 42. Stack: Constructor

The code defines two classes, **Node** and the **Stack**.

The Node class has one responsibility - to create new nodes - and it is identical to the what we have seen previously.

The Stack constructor first creates a new node using the Node constructor, then points top to this node and initializes the height to 1.
