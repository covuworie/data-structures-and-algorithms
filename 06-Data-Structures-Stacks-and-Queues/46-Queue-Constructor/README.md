# 46. Queue: Constructor

The code defines two classes, **Node** and the **Queue**.

The Node class has one responsibility - to create new nodes - and it is identical to the what we have seen previously.

The Queue constructor first creates a new node using the Node constructor, then points first and last to this node and initializes the length to 1.
