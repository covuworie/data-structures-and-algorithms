# 66. Graph: Adjacency List

The second way we are going to look at representing a graph is an **adjacency list**. In an adjacency list we take each vertex in turn and represent it via a dictionary. The key represents the actual vertex we are looking at and its associated value represents a list of the vertices that it has an edge with.

## Adjacency List of a Bidirectional Graph

Below we see the adjacency list for the following bidirectional graph.

An adjacency list is what we are going to use to create our graphs in this course.
